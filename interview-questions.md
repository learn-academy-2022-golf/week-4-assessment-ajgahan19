# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your Answer:
From my understanding, That means that most if not all things are objects. I think this would be slightly easier to manage and just apply classes to the objects instead of having to create the objects as well. Functional Programming gives objects behavior and unique functionality. As a result, adding functionality to our object can change the scope of the  enviorment that the user is exopsed to. Furthermore, when adding funcationality to our code we need to consider a what a couple out side variables and a goal in mind. Every action has a reaction and every function input and output. At the end of the day it will all end. 


Researched answer: Object Oriented programming or OOP, Was made to make it easier to work with large software systems. It has been inherantly known that it creates containers for data that can be changed and manipulated without messing up the rest of the program. Functional programming is a use of functions to create the program, as opposed to objects. Functions can be passed as arguments and also returned. It appears to be possible to implement either functional or object oriented programming in some subset of programming languages.  


2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: An integer is a whole number and float is a decimal number. When we are coding we can use float to reference information that does not have even number value. In My head they only thing that I can think of that we could use float for is for scientific research. In chemesitry elements from the periodic table have un even balances. 


Researched answer: A float in ruby is "an inexact number." We have seen examples of where rounding of a float does not come out as the precise answer. 

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean? 


Your answer: An implicit return is the opposite of an explicit return. The explicit return has it stated as such, using the language-specific syntax, usually using the keyword "return".


Researched answer: Apparently describing the implicit return in a ruby block as being the "last line" is a little simplistic, and it would be more accurate to use the term "last expression." The default return is nil. Ruby has the option of using either implicit or explicit return, however taking advantage of the implicit version appears to be convention.

4. What is a block in Ruby? 

Your answer: A block in ruby is a function that gets passed onto a method. A block in Ruby is analogous to functions in javascript, they have a name and return a value. They do not belong to objects, those are known as methods. 


Researched answer: A ruby block is enclosed in do/end statements, along with curly braces {}. Arguments for the block are included within pipes ||. To amend my earlier answer, blocks do not have to have a name. They can execute built-in ruby methods and avoid being given an identifier. Or they can be given a name and execute custom code.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer:
 To extract a value in a Ruby hash, you use the "symbol" for the hash. The symbol is text which identifies the specific entry in the hash, and can be used to reference the value of that particular symbol/value pair.

 Researched answer:
 I was wrong in my above statement in the use of a symbol for the key in the key value pair. The key in Ruby can be almost any data type.

##Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Class Inheritance:
 Class inheritance appears to involve basing new classes off of existing classes so as to implement many of the same features while minimizing the effort of writing code for new behavior. 

 2. RSpec:
 RSpec is the Ruby equivalent of a Jest testing framework for Ruby code. It was written in Ruby as well. It is possible that it is not the default Ruby testing framework, however appears to be the most popular one. The term "behavior driven development" appears to be popular in the relevant Google searches, and appears to be a loose technical term.

 3. CRUD:
 Create, Read, Update, and Display is a basic concept of information management within a piece of software. One is ideally able to use software to create an entry or upload data, to read/ display that entry or others like it, to update it, and to delete it. 

 4. Test-driven development:
 An approach to programming which emphasizes what outputs are expected for any given input and are coded into tests. We have used Jest to do tests with JavaScript. RSpec appears to be a related tool in this toolset.

 5. HTTP:
 Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is the method of transferring website information over the web. It is located 7th as the application layer of the open systems interconnection model. Just below it on the 6th layer is the presentation layer. Is the format set by the application layer for outgoing messages.
